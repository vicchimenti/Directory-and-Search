# SessionService Optimization Migration Summary

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Project**: Migrate SessionService optimizations from `su-search-dev` to `su-search` production  
**Status**: Migration complete, ready for production deployment  
**Branch**: `migration-sessionservice-optimizations`

---

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Created Migration Branch
- Created branch: `migration-sessionservice-optimizations` in `su-search` production repo
- Based on production baseline tag: `production-baseline-pre-sessionservice-20250926`
- Branch published to GitHub and visible in Vercel

### 2. Migrated 7 Files from Development to Production

All files copied from `su-search-dev` with endpoint updates applied:

| # | File | Status | Commit Message |
|---|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | `public/integration.js` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(integration): update endpoints for production deployment` |
| 2 | `next.config.js` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(config): update endpoints for production deployment` |
| 3 | `pages/api/search.ts` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(search): add search API route from dev` |
| 4 | `lib/cache.ts` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(cache): add cache layer from dev` |
| 5 | `lib/pre-render.ts` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(pre-render): update error messages for production env` |
| 6 | `lib/utils.ts` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(utils): add utility functions from dev` |
| 7 | `public/search-page-autocomplete.js` | ✅ Complete | `migrate(autocomplete): update endpoints for production deployment` |

### 3. Endpoint Changes Applied

All development endpoints successfully updated to production:

```
Development → Production
/search-test/ → /search/
su-search-dev.vercel.app → su-search.vercel.app
funnelback-proxy-dev.vercel.app → funnelback-proxy.vercel.app
```

### 4. Testing Completed

**Preview Deployment URL:**
```
https://su-search-git-migration-sessionservice-optimizations-su-web-ops.vercel.app
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Search API endpoint working: `/api/search?query=admissions&collection=seattleu~sp-search&profile=_default`
- ✅ Suggestions API working: `/api/suggestions?query=admissions`
- ✅ SessionService integration verified with session IDs
- ✅ Response headers showing correct cache status
- ✅ Backend connection to production proxy confirmed

### 5. Code Cleanup
- Removed obsolete commented code from `search-page-autocomplete.js`
- Updated Redis configuration in `cache.ts` to use environment variables
- Updated error messages to reference production environment

## Performance Improvements to Deploy

Once merged to production, these improvements will be active:

| Metric | Before (Production) | After (Migration) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Cache HIT searches | ~754ms | ~424ms | 44% faster |
| Cache MISS searches | ~1436ms | ~1070ms | 25% faster |
| SessionService calls | 4-6 per search | 1 per page load | ~80% reduction |

**Key Optimizations:**
- Eliminated redundant cache-first fallback
- Removed duplicate SessionService initialization calls
- Simplified session ID usage to read-only pattern
- Clean separation of concerns between SessionService and search logic

---

## Next Steps - Production Deployment

### Step 1: Merge to Production (When Ready)

```bash
# Navigate to su-search repo
cd path/to/su-search

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Ensure up to date
git pull origin main

# Merge migration branch
git merge migration-sessionservice-optimizations

# Push to trigger production deployment
git push origin main
```

This will automatically deploy to: `su-search.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Post-Deployment Validation

**Immediately after deployment:**

Monitor these items:

1. **Vercel Deployment Status**
   - Check Vercel dashboard for successful deployment
   - Verify no build errors

2. **API Endpoint Functionality**
   ```
   https://su-search.vercel.app/api/search?query=test&collection=seattleu~sp-search&profile=_default
   ```
   Should return search results HTML

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Cache HIT searches: Should be ~400-450ms
   - Cache MISS searches: Should be ~1000-1100ms
   - Check response headers for `X-Cache-Status`

4. **Error Monitoring**
   - Check Vercel logs for any new errors
   - Monitor for 500 errors or API failures

5. **CMS Integration**
   - Verify search works on embedded pages at www.seattleu.edu
   - Test autocomplete suggestions
   - Verify tab navigation
   - Check analytics tracking

### Step 3: Create Production Tag (Recommended)

```bash
# Tag the successful production deployment
git tag production-sessionservice-optimized-20250929
git push origin production-sessionservice-optimized-20250929
```

### Step 4: Cleanup

```bash
# Delete migration branch after successful deployment
git branch -d migration-sessionservice-optimizations
git push origin --delete migration-sessionservice-optimizations
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise after production deployment:

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard Rollback
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find previous deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Option 2: Git Revert
```bash
git checkout main
git revert [merge-commit-hash]
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Redeploy Previous Tag
```bash
git checkout production-baseline-pre-sessionservice-20250926
git push origin main --force  # Use with caution
```

---

## Environment Configuration Check

Before deployment, verify these environment variables are set correctly in Vercel:

### Required Variables:
- `BACKEND_API_URL` → Should point to `https://funnelback-proxy.vercel.app/proxy`
- `KV_URL` or `KV_URL_SU_SEARCH` → Should point to **production Redis instance**

### Optional Variables:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `CACHE_LOG_LEVEL=2`
- `API_CLIENT_LOG_LEVEL=2`

**Important**: Ensure Redis configuration uses production instance, not development.

---

## Key Files Modified

### Core Search Files:
- **`public/integration.js`** - Main search integration with SessionService optimizations
- **`public/search-page-autocomplete.js`** - Autocomplete with pre-rendering support

### API Layer:
- **`pages/api/search.ts`** - Search API endpoint
- **`lib/cache.ts`** - Multi-tier caching with optimized TTLs
- **`lib/pre-render.ts`** - Pre-rendering system for instant results

### Configuration:
- **`next.config.js`** - Updated headers configuration
- **`lib/utils.ts`** - Utility functions (includes May update)

## Testing Strategy for New Chat Session

When you return to test the production deployment:

### 1. Direct API Testing (Quick Verification)
```bash
# Test search endpoint
curl "https://su-search.vercel.app/api/search?query=admissions&collection=seattleu~sp-search&profile=_default"

# Test suggestions endpoint  
curl "https://su-search.vercel.app/api/suggestions?query=admissions"
```

### 2. Browser Testing (Full Verification)
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Visit embedded search page on www.seattleu.edu
3. Perform test searches
4. Check response headers:
   - `X-Cache-Status` (HIT/MISS)
   - `X-Client-IP-Source` (IP resolution method)
5. Monitor response times
6. Verify autocomplete suggestions
7. Test tab navigation and facets

### 3. Performance Validation
- Compare cache HIT/MISS times against baseline
- Check for any performance degradation
- Verify session continuity across searches

## Notes for New Chat Session

**To bring Claude up to speed quickly:**

1. Share this document
2. Mention you completed migration but haven't merged to production yet
3. Explain what specific testing or deployment help you need
4. Provide any error logs or issues encountered

**Current State:**
- All files migrated and tested on preview deployment
- Ready to merge to `main` branch when you're comfortable
- No blockers identified during testing
- Expected performance improvements validated in preview

**Next Session Topics:**
- Production deployment execution
- Post-deployment monitoring
- Performance validation
- Any issues or adjustments needed

---

## Additional Context

### Architecture Notes:
- This is a **CMS-integrated API**, not a standalone application
- Search pages are embedded on www.seattleu.edu
- Direct page routes (like `/search`) may 404 - this is expected
- Testing should focus on API endpoints and embedded functionality

### Migration Pattern:
- Used branch-based migration strategy
- Kept commit history clean and organized
- Each file migrated with specific commit message
- Preview deployment tested before production merge

### Performance Context:
- Optimizations from development environment (su-search-dev)
- Based on snapshot: `snapshot-dev-sessionservice-optimized-20250912`
- Production baseline: `production-baseline-pre-sessionservice-20250926`
- Improvements focused on SessionService integration and cache flow
