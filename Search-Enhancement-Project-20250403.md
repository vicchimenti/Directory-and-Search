# Seattle University Search Interface Enhancement Project

## Current Progress Summary
- ✅ Implemented header search autocomplete
- ✅ Created three-column layout for search results page autocomplete
- ✅ Set up click tracking for search results and suggestions
- ✅ Successfully deployed to development environment

## Next Phase: Advanced Search UI Components

### 1. Tabbed Navigation
The tabbed navigation will allow users to filter search results by content type, creating a more organized user experience.

**Key Requirements:**
- Tab categories: All Results, Pages, People, Programs, News, Events
- Active tab styling with appropriate visual indicators
- Tab selection persistence across search refinements
- Analytics tracking for tab interaction
- Accessible keyboard navigation between tabs

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Tab state management (URL parameters vs. session storage)
- Mobile-responsive design for tab display
- Performance optimization for changing between tabs

### 2. Pagination
Implement pagination to make browsing through large result sets more manageable.

**Key Requirements:**
- Standard pagination with previous/next buttons
- Current page indicator
- Option to jump to specific pages
- Configurable results per page
- Mobile-friendly pagination controls

**Implementation Considerations:**
- URL parameter structure (page number, results per page)
- Handling edge cases (last page with fewer results)
- Performance implications of different pagination strategies

### 3. Faceted Search
Faceted search will enable users to refine search results based on specific attributes.

**Key Requirements:**
- Common facets: Content Type, Department, Topic, Date Range
- Multi-select capabilities for facet values
- Count indicators showing number of results per facet value
- Clear filters option
- Mobile-friendly facet display and interaction

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Nested facets for hierarchical data
- Performance impact of multiple facet selections
- Caching strategies for facet data
- URL parameter handling for facet state

### 4. Collapsible Elements
Implement expandable/collapsible sections to make the search interface more compact and focused.

**Key Requirements:**
- Collapsible facet groups
- Expandable search result details
- Saved state for expand/collapse between sessions
- Accessible expand/collapse controls
- Animation for smooth transitions

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Aria attributes for accessibility
- Performance of animations on mobile devices
- State management for multiple collapsible elements

## Technical Approach

### File Structure
```
/public
  /js
    integration.js            // Core search functionality
    search-page-autocomplete.js  // Autocomplete implementation
    search-tabs.js           // Tab navigation implementation
    search-pagination.js     // Pagination implementation
    search-facets.js         // Faceted search implementation
    search-collapsible.js    // Collapsible elements implementation
  /css
    search-components.css    // Styles for all search components
```

### Integration with Funnelback
- All components will communicate with the Funnelback backend via the proxy API
- Response formatting will maintain consistency with existing data structures
- Minimize dependencies to ensure optimal performance

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of search components when needed
- Efficient DOM manipulation to prevent layout shifts
- Request throttling and debouncing for user interactions
- Cache management for repeated searches and facet data

### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all new components
- Keyboard navigation support throughout the interface
- Screen reader compatibility with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Focus management for interactive elements

## Testing Strategy
- Component-level testing for each new feature
- Integration testing with existing search functionality
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Tabbed Navigation** - 2 days
2. **Pagination** - 2 days
3. **Faceted Search** - 3 days
4. **Collapsible Elements** - 2 days
5. **Integration & Testing** - 3 days

## Questions to Discuss
- Priority order for implementation of these features
- Specific design preferences for each component
- Analytics requirements for new user interactions
- Performance expectations and benchmarks
- Browser/device support requirements
