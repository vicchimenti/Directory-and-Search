Search System Integration Plan
Current Status

SessionService.js is now correctly deployed and working
Integration.js is successfully retrieving session IDs from SessionService
Basic functionality is working without errors

Next Steps
1. Update Integration.js with SessionService Name - DONE

Rename all instances of getSessionManager to getSessionService
Update any log messages or comments referring to "SessionManager"
Consider adding more robust logging to track SessionService initialization

2. Extend Integration to Other Components

Next component to integrate: search-page-autocomplete.js

Similar pattern: check for SessionService, with fallback
Focus on maintaining user experience as top priority



3. API Integration

Modify pages/api/enhance.ts to use SessionService
Modify pages/api/search.ts and suggestions.ts next
Add normalizeUrl functionality to remove duplicate sessionIds

4. Testing Strategy

Verify in different loading scenarios (fast/slow connections)
Test in private browsing mode (to test sessionStorage fallbacks)
Check for duplicate sessionIds in URLs

5. Documentation Updates

Document the new SessionService architecture
Create usage examples for future developers
Add monitoring recommendations for tracking session consistency

Goals for Next Session

Complete integration.js updates for SessionService naming
Begin integration with search-page-autocomplete.js
Discuss potential API-level integrations

Notes

Typescript vs JavaScript issue resolved by using pure JS for browser-executed code
SessionService now provides a centralized source of truth for session IDs
User experience is maintained even when SessionService initialization is delayed
